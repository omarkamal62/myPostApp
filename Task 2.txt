TASK 2

Line 10: @Component => means that is class will be autodetect by Spring framework for dependency injection

Line 13, 14:

	private UserValidationServiceImpl us
	private ParamServiceImpl serviceImpl
	
	=> common use of service is to be an interface with all methods that going to be
	 used and class implements these methods from the interface, that class has
	 @service annotation that specify that it will be used as service layer
	the class (VerifyHelper) has fields of the implemented classes and it should be
	theinterfaces.

Lines 50-55:
	
	public VerifyHelper(){
		us = (UserValidationServiceImpl) SpringSupport.getBean("userValidation");
		serviceImpl = (ParamServiceImpl) SpringSupport.getBean("paramService");

	=> Constructor for VerifyHelper() has two class fields initialized with Class (SpringSupport)
	that contains a static method getBean in order to use these two services in the class. but i think
	also that common use and a better use of spring is to use @Autowired annotation to inject the services
	instead of creating a class help us inject them.

Lines 24-27:
	
	use the result of split array specifically in array elements of 0,1. what if str doesn't have ';' in it
	we will get arrayOutOfBounds Exception for (split[1]). there must be a check for the length of the array
	if less than 2 to avoid getting error
